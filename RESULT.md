## Findings and Reflection.  
Through this project, the deaf people should be able to use the bot services more frequently without facing any difficulties in reading and typing. It would become as convenient as it is for all of us.  
With some more equivalent time, this SmartAccessibleBot can be even extended to be used by the blind people by adding a Braille API services to it.  
Also, adding a speech recognition and translation system will make the bot universal. Anyone will be able to use the Bot services. Any business can implement this Bot by just simply calling the API and do not have to worry about scalability and elasticity because everything will be managed in the Azure Cloud.
