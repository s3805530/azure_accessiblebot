## Findings and Reflection.  
Through this project, the deaf people should be able to use the bot services more frequently without facing any difficulties in reading and typing. It would become as convenient as it is for all of us.  
The achieved accuracy of the trained model is not 100%, however with given some more time, the accuracy can get better with improvements in the code and dataset.  
The dataset can be further extended with words sign language and with other countries sign language as well.
With some more equivalent time, this SmartAccessibleBot can be even extended to be used by the blind people by adding a **Braille API services** to it.  
Also, adding a **speech recognition and translation system** will make the bot universal.  
Anyone will be able to use the Bot services. Any business can implement this Bot by just simply calling the API and do not have to worry about scalability and elasticity because everything will be managed in the Azure Cloud.
