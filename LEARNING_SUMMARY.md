## Learning journey
While making this project I have learned a lot of new things about Artificial Intelligence and Microsoft Azure.  
Starting from not knowing anything about machine learning to actually building a SmartBot which can understand sign languages,which not only uses a trained ML model but also solves a community problem, I have learned a gained a whole different experience.  
I have learned different machine learning models and got a clear idea on when and how to use them. Also, gained knowledge on Azure ML Studio and its usage,but still getting better at developing these skills.  
I am very excited to increase my further knowledge on training different machine learning models and try achieving more accuracy in the prediction. In the beginning I was not confident, if I would be able to implement this project,but with the help of Microsoft learning modules,workshops,some youtube videos I was able to complete the projects even though it can be still improved a lot.
